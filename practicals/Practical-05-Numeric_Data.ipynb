    "\n",
    "After a couple of weeks getting to grips with Python itself, we're now going to start working with some real data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first things that we do when working with any new data set is to familiarise ourselves with it. There are a _huge_ number of ways to do this, but there are no shortcuts to:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>a. Reading about the data (how it was collected, what the sample size was, etc.)</li>\n",
    "  <li>b. Reviewing any accompanying metadata (data about the data, column specs, etc.)</li>\n",
    "  <li>c. Looking at the data itself at the row- and column-levels</li>\n",
    "  <li>d. Producing descriptive statistics </li>\n",
    "  <li>e. Visualising the data using plots </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you should use _all_ of these together to really understand where the data came from, how it was handled, and whether there are gaps or other problems. If you're wondering which comes first, the concept of  _start with a chart_ is always good.  But this week we want you to get a handle on pandas itself so although we will do some plotting of charts, we'll focus on a-d. There will be much more on plotting charts next week."

    "## 1. What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas stands for 'Python Data Analysis Library'; it is designed to provide data scientists working in Python with a set of powerful tools to load, transform, and process large-ish data sets. As a result, it has become something of a *de facto* standard for online tutorials and many of the lessons that you can find online will make use of pandas at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond what we provide below there are [numerous](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=introduction+to+pandas+python) useful introductions; [one of our favourites](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/) is from Greg Reda, and there are some [good videos](https://youtu.be/TSsSWuhBpmY) on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ5Y5hxm-0W7rOOYBHf6KC6QNnWOi09kh). And of course, there’s [TONS of stuff](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas) on StackOverflow. If you want an actual physical book, you might try [McKinney (2017)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050896.do).\n",

    "However, one thing you will really want to bookmark is [the official documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) since you will undoubtedly need to refer to it fairly regularly. _Note_: this link is to the most recent release. Over time there will be updates published and you _may_ find that you no longer have the most up-to-date version. If you find that you are now using an older version of pandas then you'll need to track down the _specific_ version of the documentation that you need from the [home page](http://pandas.pydata.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always check what version you have installed like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "print(pd.__version__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Note*: this approach isn't guaranteed to work with _every_ package, but it will work with most of them. Remember that variables and methods starting and ending with '`__`' are **private** and any interaction with them should be approached very, very carefully.\n",

For example, while the LSOA data at ~7MB has only around 40 columns and 4,800 rows, larger data sets like the London [InsideAirBnB data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) come in at nearly 50MB, and the OS' OpenRoads data set is more than 500MB! Reading and writing that amount of data will slow things down quite a bit!

If we set up our analysis then the answer is: it doesn't matter! We should be able to just run the analysis on the subset of data and then re-run it on the _entire_ data set later (by changing the number of lines we read into memory right at the start of the analysis process or just removing `nrows...` from the `read_csv` method).\n",

So it calculates the `True`/`False` for the left side and the `True`/`False` for the right side of the `&`, and then combines them. Look at the appendix to this notebook for more examples and options.\n",

    "One of the first things we should do when exploring a new dataset is plot (aka graph) the data. We've left plotting until a little later in this practical so that we could see some other basic attributes of how pandas stores data. We'll look at plotting and exploratory data analyses in much more detail next week, including using packages other than pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's look at the basic plotting functionality pandas provides - in conjunctions with the online documentation for both [DataFrames](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#plotting) and [Series](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#api-dataframe-plotting). There are also examples of all [the different types of plots pandas can produce](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html)."

    "Kind of handy, no? These aren't the _best_ looking plots, but they are all being generated on-the-fly for you by pandas with no more than a cheery `DataFrame.Series.plot.<plot type>`! Since those plots are all just method calls, many of them take optional parameters to change the colour, the notation (scientific or not), and other options. For example, many of the documentation pages linked to above are rather brief, but include a link to [the general options that can be applied to all `Series.plot`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.plot.html#pandas.Series.plot) calls.\n",

    "This is why we like pandas: it allows us to be _constructively lazy_. We don't need to know _how_ a draw a KDE plot (though it always helps if you don't see what you expected), we just need to know that pandas provides a method that will do it for you. And _that_ is why it's always worth having a [look at the documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#plotting). "

    "\n",
    "That's it for the Cities data. Now that we've progressed (rather rapidly) from using our own code to using pandas, we're ready for the big leagues! For much of the remainder of the module, and **for your final report**, we will be working with data for London that are aggregated spatially into geographical units known as Lower Super Output Area (**LSOAs**). Hence, we will refer to these data as the ***LSOA data***. \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundaries of LSOAs are adminstered by the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (ONS) and used to analyse [UK Census](https://census.ukdataservice.ac.uk) and other data. You can read more about [the ONS coding system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONS_coding_system), find out about the [UK census geography](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography), and explore [census data at LSOA level for London](http://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/instant-atlas/lsoa-atlas1/atlas.html).   \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we have created and which you can use and build on is designed to provide a diverse range of data types so that there is 'something for everyone' -- physical and human geographer alike (and anything in between!) -- to work with. The sources and types of data in the initial LSOA dataset we will examine are: \n",
    "* [London Data Store](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london) provides the geography and some basic census data \n",
    "* [OS Greenspace](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-greenspace.html) provides data about the amount of greenspace\n",
    "* [OS VectorMap](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/vectormap-district.html) (District) provides data about distances to major roads\n",
    "* [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011) provides more detailed census data\n",
    "* [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) scrapes information from the AirBnB website\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in term we will see how we can 'add' additional (air pollution) data to this initial dataset, but this is more than enough to be going on with for now! Don't spend too long looking at these links now, as we'll get on with exploring the data themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a metadate file in Excel that provides information about the variables contained in the LSOA data. Look at that [metadata file](https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/geocomputation/raw/master/Data/LSOA_metadata.xlsx) now (file should auto-download; also available on KEATS). \n",
    "\n",
    "Come back to this section later to look at the links make sure you understand how what the data represent, how they were collected, etc. as this is important understanding that will support your data analyses.    "
